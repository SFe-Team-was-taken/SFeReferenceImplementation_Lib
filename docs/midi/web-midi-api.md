## LibMIDIPort

A shared interface between `LibMIDIInput` and `LibMIDIOutput`.

### port

The actual `MIDIPort` object this instance represents.

### id, name, manufacturer, version

Mirrored from the inner `MIDIPort`.

## LibMIDIInput

### connect

```

- synth - the synthesizer to connect to.

### disconnect

Disconnects the input from a given synth.

```ts
output.connect(seq);
```

- seq - the sequencer to connect to.

### disconnect

Disconnects sequencer from the output, making it play to the attached Synthesizer instead.
